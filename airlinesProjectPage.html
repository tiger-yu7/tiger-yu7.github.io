                <p class="sectionParagraph">Most who have flown are familiar with in-flight magazines tucked in the seats in front of us. These magazines inspire about various destinations and local lifestyle, but usually don't inform about the destination customers are heading to next. Indeed, it is hard to do so when the same magazine is used for flights between countless destinations. As vacation travel begins to pick up again, travelers will seek to discover more cultural inspiration and crave curated experiences.</p>

We wanted to personalize the in-flight entertainment time for the guest using technology in a future-forward way.</p>

                <p class="sectionParagraph">Our goal was to find out how these travellers planned their trips - and how an in-flight entertainment app could help them in providing additional information.</p>

                <p class="sectionParagraph">Our research told us that users are mostly satisfied with current entertainment options - including movies, shows, and music. However, they use in-flight entertainment as a means to pass-time, rather than viewing content that may enrich their travel experience. Many mentioned that they travel for experiences, and would like there to be entertainment options - editorials in our case - pertaining to their travel experiences.</p>

They would like to know more about about attractions they can experience and would benefit from information on such experiences.</p>

                <p class="sectionParagraph">Designing this mobile application was a great experience. Through creating an interface that allowed minimal time spent on screen, I learned to utilize icons and layouts that are intuitive to navigate and convey information. It is important to note that the actual feasibility of this product would be quite difficult from an engineering perspective - given the lack of technological integration that city parking has. Because of this, it would be difficult to provide comprehensive information to users on the availability of parking as well as to provide the ability to reserve spots. However, through research and collecting information on the current resources available, it is clear that parking is a major obstacle for a large demographic of drivers in metropolitan areas.</p>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">With upcoming technologies such as smarthomes and building automation, there is no doubt that one day parking lots will have some form of software integration and management. With this, Parking App can become a feasible product to help find parking.</p>

                <h4>What I would have done differently?</h4>
                <br>
                <h5 class="italics lightOrange">Use surveys instead of interviews</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">Because of our one-week time constraint, performing interviews took a lot of our time and in hindsight, it would have been better to perhaps use a survery instead. This would have saved time and reached a larger demographic.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="italics lightOrange">Try to not allow my own travel experiences to affect the solution</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">As a traveller myself, I found myself reflecting on my own experiences during the design process. Although other travellers had similar experiences to my own with in-flight entertainment apps, it was challenging to stay focused on what our research told us rather than my own experiences.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="italics lightOrange">Take advantage of UI kits</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">Again due to our time constraints, I wish I had used design systems and assets already available on Adobe XD. This would have saved time when prototyping since we could skip the step of creating individual components. In addition, having pre-made assets helps to create a consistent UI.</p>
