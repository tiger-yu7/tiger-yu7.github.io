                <p class="sectionParagraph">As cities grow, they are often challenged with the problem of a disporportionate number of cars to parking spaces. This has lead to finding parking to become an increasingly difficult task - leading to a large overhead in transportation times. This problem ends up affecting both consumers and buisnesses.</p>

                <h4>Consumer Impact</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">Due to the continued and growing development of large cities such as Toronto, finding parking becomes an increasingly difficult and time-consuming task for drivers. Between the years of 1978 and 2019, the city of Toronto lost roughly 40% of its surface parking. Drivers often resort to simply "driving around" in hopes of finding a parking spot.</p>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">This problem is exacerbated by the other obstacles of growing cities - traffic and construction. Overall, it amounts to wasted time for consumers, with most drivers also reporting that they felt stressed while having to look for parking in a city like Toronto.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h4>Business Impact</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">Because consumers must face the challenges and overhead of finding parking, some opt to simply avoid it all together. Consumers choose to avoid certain areas or shop online instead. This all leads to lost consumers for local businesses - especially smaller ones that do not offer alternatives such as online shopping.</p>

                <h2 class="centeredText italics lightOrange">The major pain point is time being spent searching for spots. Therefore, our objective should be to give users prior information on availability.</h2>

                <div class="sectionTitleText">User Research</div>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">In order to understand what users would want from a parking-finding app, we conducted a series of surveys with 16 individuals. Our surveys found individuals typically relied on visitor parking if they were driving into busy regions in order to visit friends. However, when this option wasn't available - such as in the event of attending a concert - they would often have to resort to simply driving around to look for parking.</p>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">When asked about what drivers would want to know from the app, the general consensus would be to know how busy a parking lot or street would be at the time of their arrival, as well as the cost and duration they can park for.</p>
                <h3 class="italics">Users want information on:</h4>
                <br>
                <h3 class=" indent lightOrange italics">1. Pricing</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent lightOrange italics">2. Location</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent lightOrange italics">3. Availability</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Interviews</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">Conducted semi-structured interviews with 3 individuals regarding their experiences when driving to a busy city and their experiences with finding parking. This helped me better understand the various problems people may face when travelling as well as where these problems tend to occur in their journey. </p>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">The findings from the interviews further validated the data I gathered from the user surveys regarding the pain points that exist when looking for parking in a busy city.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">With the information gathered from surveys and interviews, we began the process of creating Parking App. We started by defining our app's target demographic and created user personas.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="">Demographic</h4>
                <br>
                <h3 class=" indent lightOrange italics">- Travellers planning day trips to popular attractions</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent lightOrange italics">- Drivers looking to finding parking on an ad-hoc basis</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">We chose to break down our demographic into two main groups because of how they might use the app differently. Travellers who are planning trips to busy cities such as Toronto would want to be able to know about the availability of parking beforehand, plus have the ability to reserve a parking space in advance. In addition, they may be more willing to pay for more expensive parking if it can allow them to park for longer periods of time, or be close to their desired location.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class=" indent italics"><span class="lightOrange">As a</span> tourist in Toronto</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent italics"><span class="lightOrange">I want</span> to reserve parking for an afternoon by Harbourfront</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent italics"><span class="lightOrange">so that</span> I can visit the CN Tower and Aquarium</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">On the other hand, drivers looking for parking on an ad-hoc basis are more likely to care about other factors. Many of these drivers are those whose occupation requires navigating busy cities in a vehicle. For them, they would likely prefer the cheapest and nearest parking - the more economical option - rather than parking that may be more desirable. They are also more likely to only need parking for a short duration of time (15-30 minutes) and not require the need to reserve.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class=" indent italics"><span class="lightOrange">As a</span> delivery driver</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent italics"><span class="lightOrange">I want</span> to find free parking for 5 minutes near me</h3>
                <h3 class=" indent italics"><span class="lightOrange">so that</span> I can deliver items to someone</h3>

                <p class="sectionParagraph">Designing this mobile application was a great experience. Through creating an interface that allowed minimal time spent on screen, I learned to utilize icons and layouts that are intuitive to navigate and convey information. It is important to note that the actual feasibility of this product would be quite difficult from an engineering perspective - given the lack of technological integration that city parking has. Because of this, it would be difficult to provide comprehensive information to users on the availability of parking as well as to provide the ability to reserve spots. However, through research and collecting information on the current resources available, it is clear that parking is a major obstacle for a large demographic of drivers in metropolitan areas.</p>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">With upcoming technologies such as smarthomes and building automation, there is no doubt that one day parking lots will have some form of software integration and management. With this, Parking App can become a feasible product to help find parking.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What I would have done differently?</h4>
                <br>
                <h5 class="italics lightOrange">Pick a more feasible product</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">Although I believe my design is still valuable regardless of engineering feasibility, it would have been easier to perform a thorough competitive analysis by viewing other products that could have existed already. This would have then lead to even more meaningful and innovative design goals.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="italics lightOrange">Be able to interview/survey a larger demographic</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">If I were to conduct user surveys again, I would try to reach out to a larger group. This would help survey findings be more representative of the true demographic and provide more accurate data.</p>
                <br>
                <h5 class="italics lightOrange">Look more into colour accessibility</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">I believe accessibility to be important for any product, and while I did create a colour scheme that is soothing and relaxing to the eye, I wish I could have conducted some accessibility testing with regards to the colours.</p>
